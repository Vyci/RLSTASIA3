    <h1>The Crossroads of Faith and Modernity: A Personal Reflection</h1>

        <h2>Personal Experiences</h2>
        <p>As an Asian American with Chinese descent, my experience with religion has been shaped by my upbringing in America as well as the teachings of my parents who grew up in Fuzhou China. In my family, traditional values often intertwined with spirituality, and elements of Buddhism and Confucianism. Teachings from these religions taught me concepts such as harmony and balance, respect for elders, and common etiquettes.</p>
        <p>Transitioning from the world of my parents to my surroundings going to elementary school threw me into a melting pot of people with different backgrounds, which led to a lack of understanding between me and my peers. The lessons and traditions that were taught to me by my parents seemed foreign to the people that I surrounded myself with.</p>
        <p>This started to change as I grew older as I transitioned from my public neighborhood elementary school to one here in Philly Chinatown, Folk Arts-Cultural Treasures Charter School. I was able to gain understanding of values that were taught to me by those in my family and those who grew up in America. Over time, I was able to bridge the experience between these two completely different worlds, this dual perspective shaped who I am today allowing me to connect to my roots and retaining family traditions and understanding my broader community in tandem.</p>

        <h2>Chinese Opera</h2>
        <p>During my time at FACTS (Folk Arts-Cultural Treasures School), I had the opportunity to participate in a unique program called electives. This program offered a variety of cultural activities, including African Dance, Lion Dance, Indonesian Dance, and Zither (a traditional Chinese string instrument), among others.</p>
        <p>The elective I chose to take part in was Chinese Opera, a traditional form of musical theater in China with roots stretching back to ancient times. Through this elective, I learned various aspects of Chinese Opera, including its intricate movements and steps. Some of my earliest memories of reconnecting with my cultural heritage came from this experience.</p>
        <p>At the end of the year, every elective showcased what they had learned. I had the honor of portraying the Monkey King, a character from the classic Chinese story Journey to the West, which tells the adventures of Sun Wukong. This role allowed me to delve into the storytelling and expressive performance that Chinese Opera is known for, making it an unforgettable experience.</p>

        <h2>Family Experiences</h2>
        <p>As I grew older, I gained a deeper understanding not only for myself but also the sacrifices and resilience of my family. My parents often shared stories about the trials they faced to integrate themselves and me and my sister into the United States.</p>
        <p>There was a lot of questions that I had regarding why we did some of the things we do such as something as basic as taking off your shoes indoors and the obsessions with the color red during Chinese New Year but as time passed, I could see how hard my parents had to try to preserve our cultural heritage while trying to adapt to their new lives within the United States.</p>
        <p>Through their stories and actions, I came to appreciate their care for their identity while trying their best in this new world that was foreign to them.</p>

            <h3>Video Insights</h3>
            <p>Lion Dance is a traditional Chinese performance art often seen during festivals, especially the Lunar New Year, as well as at weddings and other celebratory events. It involves performers inside a large, elaborate lion costume mimicking the lion's movements to the rhythm of drums, cymbals, and gongs. The dance is believed to bring good fortune, drive away evil spirits, and ensure prosperity and luck for the event or location where it is performed. As you can see, the dance is being performed at a local business in hopes of good luck and prosperity.</p>
